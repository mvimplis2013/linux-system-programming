/* demo_sched_fifo.c
   
   This program demonstrates the use of realtime scheduling policies.
   It creates two processes, each running under the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy.
   Each process executes a function that prints a message every quarter of a second
   of CPU time. After each second of consumed CPU time, the function and calls calls
   sched_yield() to yield the CPU to the other process. Once a process has consumed 
   3 seconds of CPU time, the function terminates.

   This program must be run as a SUPERUSER, or (on Linux 2.6.12 and later) with a suitable
   RLIMIT_RTRIO resource limit,
